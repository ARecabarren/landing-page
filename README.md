Endeavor
Look at the best one, to who no one aspires to reach, being the only one building the bridge day after day, brick-to-brick. People may think that he's an example of being obsessed, but I see a clear "not yet" example in his determination.

Gai
Face at a young age your weakness or lack of talent in a world that depends on special skills. Here's an amazing example of overcoming. Gai is a practitioner and preacher of a growth mindset. Beating anyone with his pure strength developed with hard work.

Mob
You have been born with a unique and absolute talent for such a special skill. However, you just can't use it to make your life easy. Mob see the value in all the things that we might classify as "ordinary". He sees his lack of and recognizes the value of becoming stronger with exercise, intelligent due to study, friendly due to being open to meeting and caring about others.

Senku.
He firmly believes that we can improve and solve everything with science being absolutely conscious of the work, repetition, failures, and perseverance that the process involves. Resilience in every single step.
